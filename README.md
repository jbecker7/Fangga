# Fangga (ᡶᠠᠩᡤᠠ)
**ᡶᠠᠩᡤᠠ** (Fangga) means magic in Manchu, and this Anki add-on might seem like magic (if you don't know how to code lol otherwise it's just some very basic Python).

Fangga is an Anki add-on that makes it easy to go between Manchu script and Romanized Manchu following the [Möllendorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliterations_of_Manchu) system. It's very easy to use, just do the following:

1. Install the Fangga by cloning this repo and double clicking the file `Fangga.ankiaddon` or by entering `852195835` under Tools > Add-ons > Get Add-ons
2. Create a card template with the following fields: "Manchu" and "Romanization". These fields are case-sensitive--you can have whatever other fields you want, but you *must* have these two for anything to happen
3. When creating a card, fill in one of the fields
4. After that, press `Shift+Ctrl+X` or `Shift+Cmd+X`, and the other field will be filled automatically


At the moment, this works on a card by card basis... perhaps I will update it to allow for bulk card creation in the future but for now this is sufficient for my purposes.

I would like to acknowledge [this repo](https://github.com/foxal/Latin-Manchu-Transliteration-Tool/tree/master), as the way I handled Romanization->Manchu was driven by their methodology.
